Welcome, 

My name is Jarrett Lane and I am a student at Florida Polytechnic university studying cyber security.

In this repository, I would like to document CTF challenges that I have participated in or challenges that have already concluded that I have decided to look at. 
If you are visiting I hope my writeups help you. I may reference other peoples writeups but if I do I will give them credit.
